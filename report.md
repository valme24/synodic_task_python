# Matrix Code Review and Fix Summary

This document summarizes the problems identified and the corresponding fixes applied to the matrix multiplication project.

## `matrix_multiply(A, B)`

### Problem 1: Placeholder or Garbage Lines
**Issue**: Unnecessary lines (`wwwwww` and `wwww`) were present in the code.  
**Fix**: Removed placeholder lines and added a proper docstring explaining the function's purpose.

### Problem 2: Incorrect Loop Limits
**Issue**: Inner loop used `for j in range(len(B))`, which iterates over rows instead of columns of matrix B.  
**Fix**: Changed to `for j in range(len(B[0]))` to correctly iterate over columns.

### Problem 3: Missing Empty Matrix Check
**Fix**: Added validation to raise a `MatrixError` if either matrix A or B is empty:
```python
if not A or not B or not A[0] or not B[0]:
    raise MatrixError("Empty matrix provided.")
```

## `matrix_transpose(A)`

### Problem 1: Placeholder Line
**Issue**: Placeholder line (`www`) was present.  
**Fix**: Removed the line and added a proper docstring.

### Problem 2: Split Assignment
**Issue**: Code contained `row = \n []`, which caused a syntax error.  
**Fix**: Changed to `row = []`.

### Problem 3: Incorrect Indexing
**Issue**: Used `row.append(A[i][j])`, which incorrectly accessed data by rows.  
**Fix**: Replaced with `row.append(A[j][i])` to correctly access columns when transposing.

## `read_matrix_from_file(filename)`

### Problem 1: Malformed Exception and Append Logic
**Issue**: `raise` and `matrix.append(row)` were written on the same line, causing incorrect exception handling.  
**Fix**: Separated into two lines for proper exception handling:
```python
except ValueError:
    raise MatrixError(f"Invalid number in file: {line.strip()}")
matrix.append(row)
```

### Problem 2: No File-Not-Found Handling
**Fix**: Wrapped file operations in a try-except block to catch `FileNotFoundError`.

### Problem 3: No Validation for Inconsistent Row Lengths
**Fix**: Added validation to check for uniform row lengths:
```python
if len(set(len(r) for r in matrix)) > 1:
    raise MatrixError("Rows have inconsistent lengths")
```

## Additional Validation in `matrix_utils.py`

### New Exception Handling
- **Empty Matrix**: Detects if A or B is empty or has no columns.
- **Non-Rectangular Matrix**: Ensures all rows in A and B have equal length.
- **Incompatible Dimensions**: Validates that `len(A[0]) == len(B)` before multiplication.
- **Error Messaging**: Provides informative `MatrixError` messages indicating the cause of failure.

## `ConcurrentMultiplier` Class

### Problem 1: Typo in Constructor
**Issue**: Used `_init__` instead of `__init__`.  
**Fix**: Corrected to `def __init__(self, A, B):`.

### Problem 2: Invalid Syntax in Lock Declaration
**Issue**: `self.lock threading.Lock()` was incorrect.  
**Fix**: Changed to `self.lock = threading.Lock()`.

### Problem 3: Unnecessary Use of Threading Locks
**Fix**: Removed `self.lock`, as each thread only writes to a unique cell and does not require synchronization.

### Problem 4: Inefficient Thread Creation
**Issue**: A thread was created for each cell, leading to performance issues.  
**Fix**: Replaced manual thread creation with `ThreadPoolExecutor` for better thread management.

### Problem 5: Incorrect Loop Bounds
**Issue**: Used `range(len(self.B))` instead of `range(len(self.B[0]))` for column iteration.  
**Fix**: Corrected the loop bounds.

## Logging

### Problem: Lack of Logging for Concurrency
**Fix**: Added logging for better debugging and traceability.  
**Logging Setup**:
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
**Example Logging Statements**:
```python
logger.info("Starting concurrent multiplication")
logger.debug(f"Computed result[{i}][{j}] = {sum_val}")
logger.info("Finished concurrent multiplication")
```

## Summary
All critical issues related to syntax, logic, structure, and performance have been resolved. The code is now more robust, efficient, and maintainable, with proper exception handling and concurrency improvements.
