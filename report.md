🔍 Problem 1: wwwwww and wwww — placeholder or garbage lines
Fix: Remove wwwwww and add proper docstring for explanation.

🔍 Problem 2: Wrong loop limits in inner for j in range(len(B))
Why wrong? It should loop over columns of B, not rows.

Fix:

python
Copy
Edit
for j in range(len(B[0])):  # correct
🔍 Problem 3: No check for empty matrix
Fix:

python
Copy
Edit
if not A or not B or not A[0] or not B[0]:
    raise MatrixError("Empty matrix provided.")
### 🧩 matrix_transpose(A)
🔍 Problem 1: Random www — remove these and add proper docstring.
🔍 Problem 2: This code:
python
Copy
Edit
row = 
[]
is split incorrectly, which will throw a syntax error.

Fix: Combine to row = [].

🔍 Problem 3: Indexing wrong in:
python
Copy
Edit
row.append(A[i][j])
